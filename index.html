      <p>Hello! My name is Maria. I am originally from Hawaii. I am now in Portland, Oregon. I have been here for over three years. I love to travel, both domestically and internationally. I have seen all of the islands in my state as well as visiting all 50 states in the United States. As of this moment I have been to 52 countries around the world. I have lived in 2 other countries besides my own. I had been working as an RBT (registered behavior technician) working for special needs kids for 12 years before leaving to go to coding school.</p>
